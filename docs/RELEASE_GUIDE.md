## **1. Update Version Number**

1. **Update `setup.py`:**
   - Open `setup.py`.
   - Update the `version` field to the new version (e.g., `0.1.2`):
     ```python
     setup(
         name="PaleoVeg",
         version="0.1.2",  # Update this
         ...
     )
     ```

2. **Update the Download Path in `model_loader.py`:**
   - If the version number is part of the model download URL or path, update it in `model_loader.py`.
   - Example:
     ```python
     def download_model():
         url = "https://github.com/roink/PaleoVeg/releases/download/v0.1.2/model.pkl.bz2"
         ...
     ```

## **2. Clean Up the Build Directory**

     ```

   - Push the changes to the main branch:
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```

## **4. Tag the New Version**

1. **Create a Tag:**
   - Create a new Git tag for the release version:
     ```bash

     ```

2. **Push the Tag:**
   - Push the new tag to GitHub:
     ```bash
     git push origin v0.1.2
     ```

## **5. Build the Package**

1. **Build the Distribution Files:**
   - Build the source distribution (`.tar.gz`) and the wheel (`.whl`):
     ```bash
     python -m build
     ```

2. **Verify the Build:**
   - Ensure the `dist/` directory contains only the new version files:
     ```
     dist/
     ├── PaleoVeg-0.1.2-py3-none-any.whl
     ├── PaleoVeg-0.1.2.tar.gz
     ```
